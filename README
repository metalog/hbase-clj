(with-htable students, courses
  (hput students
	["01010" [:info :name "John Doe"] [:info :sex :m] [:course "101" :regular]]
	["01011" [:info :name "Jane Roe"] [:info :sex :f] [:course "101" :regular]])

	       [:student "01010" :regular] [:student "01011" :regular]])
  
  (with-open [rows (hscan students ["01000" "01999"] :info :activities)]
    (let [result (map hnvmap rows)]
      (comment do smth with results available:
